# haiku
A gadget I made in 2006 that generates random, mostly nonsensical haikus.

At work, we had a chat bot called "inky".  Periodically, whenever someone wrote a phrase that was compatible for haiku (i.e., it had 5 or 7 syllables), we'd tell the bot to memorize it.  We could then ask the bot for a haiku, which it'd generate by selecting randomly from the stored phrases.

This little JavaScript app is my version of the bot's haiku generator.
